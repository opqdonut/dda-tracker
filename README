Building
========

$ cabal configure
$ cabal build

You might need to install some dependencies, for example with:

$ cabal install cgi HDBC HDBC-sqlite3 xhtml

Installing
==========

After building, dist/build/dda-tracker/dda-tracker is a cgi executable
that can be copied anywhere. It will create a database "answers.db" in
the same directory as it resides in.

The cgi script need PathInfo, which apache provides by default.
